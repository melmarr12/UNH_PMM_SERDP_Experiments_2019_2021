# UNH_PMM_SERDP_Experiments_2019_2021
This project contains the data collected by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) Coastal Processes Lab for three field experiments focusing on investigating munition mobility in nearshore/surfzone regions. The first experiment took place on May 17 2019, the second experiment took place on February 1-2 2021, and the last experiment to place on October 26-27 2021. The data was collected at Wallis Sands Beach in Rye, New Hampshire. 

The main instrument utilized was the Pressure Mapped Munition (PMM), which is a fully autonomous cylindrical surrogate munition that can resolve the pressure field on its surface. The PMM is constructed from a 229 mm long section of 304 stainless steel pipe with a 140 mm outside diameter and 12.7 mm wall thickness. To make autonomous measurements of surface pressure and relative position, the PMM houses 16 high resolution TE Connectivity MS5837-02BA absolute pressure sensors and a Lord MicroStrain 3DMÂ®-GX5-25 inertial measurement unit (IMU). 

For the May experiment, a Nortek Vector was deployed along with the PMM. The Nortek Vector is an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) which collects high-resolution, single-point, 3-dimensional velocity data (Nortek, 2022b). For this experiment the ADV transducer was about 30 cm above the sediment bed while the ADV pressure sensor was about 50 cm above the sediment bed. The Nortek Vector was not deployed for the Feburary and October experiments.

For the February and October experiments, another instrument, the Pressure Stick (PS), was deployed with the PMM. The Pressure Stick is a fully autonomous pressure-profiling instrument. The PS contains eight micro-controlled, time-synced TE Connectivity MS5837-02BA absolute pressure and temperature sensors distributed along a 70 cm distance to measure pressure throughout the water column and into the sediment bed. The Pressure Stick allows for a quantification of intermittent bed instability (momentary liquefaction) and its potential role in munition mobility. More information about the PS can be found in Marry & Foster (2024).

Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys of the beach profile were also completed on February 2, 2021 (at the end of the experiment) and October 26, 2021 (at the beginning of the experiment), and the survey data is also included in this project. Data of the offshore wave conditions as measured by the [Jeffrey's Ledge waverider buoy (station 44098) from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=44098) for all three experiments are given here as well.

This effort was supported by Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP, Project Number 17 MR-2731). These datasets are presented in the final report for Project Number 17 MR-2731.
